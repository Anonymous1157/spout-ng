History
-------

Spout was originally written for a handheld by kuni, and soon
afterwards was ported to Windows using cygwin and sdl and released
under the MIT license.

In 2004 a 'unix version' was released, which mostly just slapped
autotools into the windows version and infringed the license.

This is a new unix version, based on the original Windows code by
kuni, which aims to add useful features and simplify the code.
